# THEOS — SECTION 0 (IMMUTABLE CORE)
## Dual Contradictory Engine Architecture with Triadic Reasoning Cycles

### 0.1 Purpose
This section is the non-negotiable foundation for all THEOS documents.
If this section is absent, the document is invalid.

### 0.2 Engines
- Engine A (CW): Constructive Reasoning
- Engine B (CCW): Critical / Adversarial Reasoning

These engines are intentionally non-redundant.
They are designed to disagree.

### 0.3 Triadic Cycle (Per Engine)
Each engine executes a full triadic reasoning cycle using fixed positions:

Clock positions:
- 12:00 — Inductive
- 4:00  — Abductive
- 8:00  — Deductive

Engine A rotates clockwise:
12 → 4 → 8 → 12

Engine B rotates counterclockwise:
12 → 8 → 4 → 12

### 0.4 Recursion & Temporal Consequence
At the completion of each cycle, the deductive output is fed back
into the inductive position for the next cycle.

The second cycle introduces the first temporal consequence:
the engine reasons about what it previously reasoned.

This is the minimal mechanism for time-aware reasoning.

### 0.5 Contradictory Torque
The engines operate simultaneously and mesh like counter-rotating gears.

Their disagreement is:
- Mandatory
- Structured
- Measurable

Contradiction is treated as signal, not noise.

The interaction compresses reasoning through friction,
analogous to steel rollers refining material or wringer gears removing water.

### 0.6 Governor (Selector & Clutch)
The Governor is not a reasoning engine.

It:
- Selects cycle count
- Engages or disengages either engine
- Adjusts contradiction pressure
- Permits single-engine execution when sufficient
- Authorizes stopping, refusal, or degradation

The Governor governs engines.
Engines never govern themselves.

### 0.7 Wisdom Accumulation
Wisdom is not memory.

Wisdom is compressed consequence derived from prior contradictions.

It is stored as:
- Outcome deltas
- Failure signatures
- Stop justifications

Wisdom biases future cycle counts, stopping decisions,
and refusal thresholds.

### 0.8 Invariants
- No answer without at least one completed triadic cycle
- No recursion without state carry-forward
- No contradiction → no compression
- No governance without engine outputs

- [ ] Governor role clearly defined as non-reasoning controller
- [ ] Contradiction treated as mandatory signal, not optional noise
- [ ] Wisdom defined as compressed consequence, not raw memory
- [ ] No claims of reasoning without engine execution
- [ ] No claims of governance without Governor authority
- [ ] Temporal consequence mechanism present (recursion with state carry-forward)
- [ ] Document declares dependencies on prior THEOS documents if applicable
