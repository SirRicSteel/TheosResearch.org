# THEOS Formal Invariant I7
## Wisdom Accumulation Without Autonomous Governance Mutation

### Status
**Frozen – Governance Invariant**

### Purpose
To formally separate *learning* (wisdom accumulation) from *authority* (governance mutation), ensuring THEOS can grow wiser over time without silently changing its own constitutional constraints.

---

### Invariant Statement

1. **Wisdom Accumulation is Permitted**
   - THEOS may continuously accumulate:
     - Outcome histories
     - Regret analyses
     - Calibration data
     - Pattern abstractions (GMAs)
   - This accumulation may influence *recommendations*, *confidence estimates*, and *advisory signals*.

2. **Governance Parameters Are Immutable Without Approval**
   - The following **MUST NOT self-modify** through learning alone:
     - Risk ceilings
     - Stop thresholds
     - Contradiction budgets
     - Break-glass conditions
     - Degradation modes
   - No automatic self-tuning of governance is allowed.

3. **Wisdom ≠ Authority**
   - Accumulated wisdom may *inform* governance decisions
   - Accumulated wisdom may *not enact* governance changes
   - Authority remains external, explicit, and auditable

4. **Change Path Requirement**
   - Any governance modification requires:
     - Explicit proposal
     - External approval (human or institutional)
     - Cryptographic audit trail
     - Versioned commit

5. **Failure Mode Prevention**
   - Prevents:
     - Slow, silent power escalation
     - Goodhart-driven governance drift
     - Emergent constitutional mutation
     - “Learning into authority” loopholes

---

### Rationale
This invariant preserves THEOS’s core promise:
> *A system that can become wiser forever without becoming more powerful by accident.*

Wisdom grows.
Authority stays accountable.

---

### Compliance Requirement
Any implementation violating this invariant is **non-THEOS compliant**.
