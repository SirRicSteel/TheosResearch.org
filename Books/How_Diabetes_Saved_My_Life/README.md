## About This Book

This is the true story of how Frederick "Ric" Stalnecker went from a death sentence to medication-free living through self-experimentation, determination, and a refusal to accept conventional medical wisdom.

## The Story

At 190 pounds (down from 315), with a blood sugar of 1150 mg/dL, Ric walked into an emergency room in Nashville. The doctor told him he was "the worst Type 2 diabetic I've ever seen walking alive" and gave him 36 months to live.

Over the next two years, while following the medical system's protocol of 11 insulin shots per day, Ric went blind, ended up in a wheelchair, and watched his hand curl from Dupuytren's contracture.

Then he made a decision: "If I was going to die, I was gonna die trying to live."

This book chronicles his journey from that moment to complete medication-free living—a journey that involved researching supplements, experimenting on himself, and discovering a protocol that worked when nothing else did.
