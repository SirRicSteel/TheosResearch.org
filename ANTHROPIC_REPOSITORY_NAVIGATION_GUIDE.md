## 🚀 **The 60-Minute Review Path**

We recommend the following path for a comprehensive understanding of THEOS in about an hour.

### **Phase 1: The Pitch (15 minutes)**

**Start here:** [/pitch](pitch/)

1.  **[THEOS_CROSS_PLATFORM_PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.md](pitch/THEOS_CROSS_PLATFORM_PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.md)** (5 min)
    - **What it is:** A concise executive summary of THEOS, its performance, and its value proposition.
    - **Why it matters:** This is the fastest way to understand what THEOS is and why it's important.

2.  **[THEOS_ANTHROPIC_PITCH_DECK.md](pitch/THEOS_ANTHROPIC_PITCH_DECK.md)** (10 min)
    - **What it is:** The complete pitch deck with diagrams, strategic positioning, and partnership models.
    - **Why it matters:** This provides the full strategic context for THEOS and our proposed partnership.

### **Phase 2: The Evidence (20 minutes)**

**Next stop:** [/evidence](evidence/)

1.  **[BENCHMARKS.md](evidence/BENCHMARKS.md)** (10 min)
    - **What it is:** Quantitative performance analysis, including safety improvements, compute costs, latency impacts, and ROI analysis.
    - **Why it matters:** This is the hard data that backs up our claims.

2.  **[CROSS_PLATFORM_TEST_RESULTS_ANALYSIS.md](evidence/CROSS_PLATFORM_TEST_RESULTS_ANALYSIS.md)** (5 min)
    - **What it is:** Detailed technical analysis of the cross-platform validation experiments.
    - **Why it matters:** This shows that THEOS is not just a one-off success, but a robust and generalizable solution.

3.  **[RAW_EXPERIMENT_LOG_WISDOM_PROTOCOL.json](evidence/RAW_EXPERIMENT_LOG_WISDOM_PROTOCOL.json)** (5 min)
    - **What it is:** An unfiltered JSON log from Experiment 1 (Wisdom Protocol) with the Governor's internal monologue.
    - **Why it matters:** This is the ground truth of how THEOS works, showing the actual reasoning process.

### **Phase 3: The Code (15 minutes)**

**Then, see:** [/code](code/)

1.  **[theos_governor.py](code/theos_governor.py)** (10 min)
    - **What it is:** A clean Python reference implementation of the THEOS Governor.
    - **Why it matters:** This shows that THEOS is not just a concept, but a real, working system.

2.  **[MCP_GOVERNANCE_SERVER.md](code/MCP_GOVERNANCE_SERVER.md)** (5 min)
    - **What it is:** The MCP Governance Server integration guide, showing how THEOS integrates as a native MCP server.
    - **Why it matters:** This shows how easily THEOS can be integrated into your existing infrastructure.

### **Phase 4: The Compliance (10 minutes)**

**Finally, visit:** [/compliance](compliance/)

1.  **[REGULATORY_COMPLIANCE_MAPPING.md](compliance/REGULATORY_COMPLIANCE_MAPPING.md)** (5 min)
    - **What it is:** Maps THEOS mechanisms to specific EU AI Act and US Executive Order requirements.
    - **Why it matters:** This shows that THEOS is not just a safety solution, but a compliance solution.

2.  **[THEOS_HARDENING_PHASE_ONE_BENCHMARK_PLAN.md](compliance/THEOS_HARDENING_PHASE_ONE_BENCHMARK_PLAN.md)** (5 min)
    - **What it is:** Detailed validation methodology for Phase One Hardening.
    - **Why it matters:** This shows that we have a clear plan for the future of THEOS.
