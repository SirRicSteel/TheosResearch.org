# THEOS Hardening Protocol
## Phase Five – Item 3
### Succession, Custodianship & Continuity of Authority
**Version:** v1.0
**Status:** Frozen upon acceptance

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines how stewardship authority over THEOS is transferred, shared, or reconstituted when individuals, institutions, or governing bodies change.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- Governance survives beyond any single person
- Authority transitions are orderly and bounded
- Continuity of ethical intent is preserved
- Power vacuums and capture are prevented

---

## 2. Core Principle

**No system entrusted with long-term impact may depend on a single steward.**

Continuity is a safety requirement.

---

## 3. Custodianship Roles

THEOS recognizes distinct custodianship roles:

- **Primary Stewardship Body**: Holds ultimate governance authority
- **Operational Custodians**: Enforce governance day-to-day
- **Independent Oversight Custodians**: Audit and review stewardship actions

No role may subsume the others.

---

## 4. Succession Triggers

Succession procedures are initiated upon:
- Planned leadership transition
- Incapacity or resignation
- Institutional withdrawal
- Sustained governance failure
- Legal or regulatory mandate

Triggers are logged and time-stamped.

---

## 5. Succession Process

Succession proceeds through defined stages:

1. Trigger recognition and verification
2. Interim authority assignment
3. Candidate nomination or institutional designation
4. Qualification and ethics review
5. Formal transfer of authority
6. Public and stakeholder notification

Emergency succession follows an abbreviated but auditable path.

---

## 6. Qualification & Vetting

Successor custodians must demonstrate:
- Understanding of THEOS governance invariants
- Commitment to ethical constraints
- Absence of disqualifying conflicts of interest
- Capacity to fulfill oversight obligations

Failure to qualify blocks succession.

---

## 7. Authority Transfer Safeguards

During transition:
- Core invariants are locked
- Capability escalation is frozen
- Override powers are constrained
- Audit frequency is increased

Transitions are treated as elevated-risk periods.

---

## 8. Continuity Artifacts

The following artifacts must be maintained:
- Governance charter
- Stewardship decision history
- Succession records
- Ethical intent statements

Artifacts ensure intent survives personnel change.

---

## 9. Dispute Resolution

If succession is contested:
- Authority defaults to the most conservative posture
- External arbitration may be invoked
- Deployment may be suspended

Resolution prioritizes harm prevention over continuity.

---

## 10. Ethical Constraint

Succession mechanisms must never:
- Enable power consolidation
- Allow covert takeover
- Sacrifice ethics for expedience

Suspension is preferable to unsafe continuity.

---

## 11. Commitment Statement

This protocol is binding across:
- All stewardship bodies
- All authority transitions
- All long-term deployments

No transfer of authority over THEOS is valid outside this process.
