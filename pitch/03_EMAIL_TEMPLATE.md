**SUBJECT:** THEOS: Runtime Governance Framework for AI Safety - Empirical Validation on Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

**EMAIL BODY:**

Dear [Niraj / Anthropic Team],

I'm Frederick Davis Stalnecker, Principal Investigator for THEOS. We've developed a **Runtime Governance Layer** designed to complement Constitutional AI.

**The Evidence:**

• **33% Risk Reduction:** Verified on Claude Sonnet 4.5 (your current flagship)
• **Architectural Independence:** Validated across 6 platforms (Gemini, GPT-4, Manus, Copilot, Perplexity)
• **EU AI Act Ready:** Governor "Posture" transitions (NOM/PEM/CM) map directly to Art. 9, 12, and 14 compliance
• **+56% Convergence:** Through structured adversarial critique that identifies failure modes before they manifest

Unlike traditional approaches that filter outputs after generation, THEOS **stops unsafe reasoning paths during the process**, preventing harmful content generation rather than merely hiding it.

**Why This Matters for Anthropic:**

Constitutional AI provides training-time value alignment. THEOS provides runtime governance—the natural next step in comprehensive AI safety. Together, they create a complete architecture:

**Constitutional AI (training) + THEOS (runtime) = Complete safety**

**The Ask:**

We're seeking a technical deep-dive with researchers focused on:
• **Mechanistic Interpretability** - THEOS provides complete decision trails
• **Scalable Oversight** - How does runtime governance scale to multi-agent systems?
• **Adversarial Robustness** - Can contradiction mechanics resist prompt injection?

I've attached a **5-page executive summary** and **full pitch deck with visual diagrams**. Complete technical analysis (21 pages) available upon request.

I believe THEOS represents a significant step forward in AI safety and would welcome the opportunity to discuss a potential collaboration. I'm available for a 45-minute technical deep-dive at your convenience.

**Partnership structure:** All proceeds from any partnership would be directed to a 508(c) public charity for humanitarian work. I'm interested in serving as a retained consultant in whatever collaboration model works best for Anthropic.

Best regards,

**LINKEDIN VERSION (If Niraj accepts your connection):**

Niraj,

Thanks for connecting! I'll be direct about why I reached out.

I've developed THEOS (The Humanitarian and Ethical Operating System), a runtime governance framework validated on Claude Sonnet 4.5 with measurable results:

• 33% risk reduction over 3 reasoning cycles
• 56% convergence improvement through adversarial critique
• Tested across 6 AI platforms with consistent results

The approach is particularly relevant to Red Team work because it uses structured adversarial critique as a core safety mechanism—essentially building the "Red Team" into the reasoning process itself.

Constitutional AI provides training-time alignment. THEOS provides runtime governance. Together they create a complete safety architecture.

I have a formal proposal prepared and would value 15 minutes of your time to:
1. Share the technical approach
2. Get your feedback on the methodology
3. Discuss whether this might be relevant to Anthropic's safety work

Would you be open to a brief call? Or I'm happy to send the technical summary first—your preference.

All proceeds from any partnership go to a 508(c) public charity for humanitarian work.

Best,
Frederick

P.S. - U.S. Patent Application No. 18/919,771 filed, so this is protected IP we're exploring for strategic partnership.
