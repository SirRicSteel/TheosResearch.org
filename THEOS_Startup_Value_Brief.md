# THEOS — Startup Value Brief

## Why Startups Need THEOS

Startups scale faster than governance.

THEOS provides:
- safer scaling without retraining models
- lower inference costs via depth throttling
- credibility with customers, regulators, and partners
- differentiation through governance, not hype

THEOS integrates as a **governor**, not a replacement.

This allows startups to move fast without losing control.
