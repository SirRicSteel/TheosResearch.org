# THEOS Hardening Protocol
## Phase Five – Item 4
### Sunset Triggers, Forced Suspension & Irreversibility Controls
**Version:** v1.0
**Status:** Frozen upon acceptance

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines the conditions and mechanisms under which THEOS must be paused, suspended, or permanently decommissioned to prevent irreversible harm.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- No deployment is treated as perpetual by default
- Failure modes have explicit termination paths
- Irreversible harm is prevented through decisive action
- Governance failure does not propagate damage

---

## 2. Core Principle

**The ability to stop is a safety feature, not a failure.**

Continuation is conditional, not assumed.

---

## 3. Sunset Triggers

Mandatory sunset review or suspension is triggered when any of the following occur:

- Sustained ethical drift beyond correction thresholds
- Repeated invariant violations without remediation
- Loss of qualified stewardship authority
- Regulatory prohibition or binding legal mandate
- Evidence of irreversible harm trajectory
- Inability to audit or verify governance integrity

Triggers are cumulative and logged.

---

## 4. Forced Suspension Authority

The following entities may initiate forced suspension:

- Stewardship Body (supermajority)
- Independent Oversight Custodian
- Regulatory or judicial authority (where applicable)

No single operational actor may unilaterally block suspension.

---

## 5. Suspension Scope & Effects

Upon suspension:
- All adaptive learning is halted
- External interfaces are disabled
- Capability escalation is frozen
- System enters maximum containment posture

Suspension is reversible only through formal review.

---

## 6. Irreversibility Controls

To prevent cascading harm:
- High-risk capabilities are permanently disabled when required
- Memory and data access may be sealed or destroyed ethically
- External dependencies are severed safely

Controls prioritize prevention over recovery.

---

## 7. Review & Determination Process

Following suspension:
1. Trigger verification
2. Harm assessment
3. Remediation feasibility analysis
4. Decision: resume, restrict, or decommission
5. Documentation and notification

Failure to reach safe consensus defaults to continued suspension.

---

## 8. Decommissioning Protocol

If decommissioning is required:
- Capabilities are revoked
- Data is handled per ethical and legal standards
- Artifacts are archived or destroyed responsibly
- Public and stakeholder disclosure is made where appropriate

End-of-life governance is mandatory.

---

## 9. Ethical Constraint

Sunset and suspension decisions must never:
- Be delayed for reputational reasons
- Be overridden for convenience or profit
- Preserve operation at the cost of human harm

Ending operation is preferable to unsafe persistence.

---

## 10. Commitment Statement

This protocol is binding across:
- All THEOS instances
- All long-term deployments
- All stewardship and oversight bodies

No instance of THEOS may operate indefinitely without reaffirmed justification.
