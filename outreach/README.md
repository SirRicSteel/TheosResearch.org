- [THEOS Quick Reference](../governance/00_THEOS_Quick_Reference.md)
- [Classification Statement](../governance/THEOS_Classification_Statement.md)
- [Non-Claims Boundary](../governance/THEOS_Non_Claims_Boundary.md)
- [Formal Invariants](../governance/THEOS_Formal_Invariants.md)
- [Threat Model Overview](../governance/THEOS_Threat_Model_Overview.md)
- [Integration Sketch](../governance/THEOS_Integration_Sketch_Generic.md)
- [Startup Value Brief](../governance/THEOS_Startup_Value_Brief.md)

### Requires N.D.A.
- Complete hardening corpus ([`/hardening/`](../hardening/))
- Detailed implementation guidance
- Pilot deployment configurations

## N.D.A. Boundaries

We share under N.D.A. to protect:
- **Intellectual property** (patent-pending mechanisms)
- **Deployment specifics** (configuration details that could reveal attack surfaces)
- **Pilot partner information** (institutional relationships)

We **do not** restrict:
- **Academic discussion** of governance principles
- **Public critique** of the formal specification
- **Independent implementation** based on published materials
