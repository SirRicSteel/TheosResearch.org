# THEOS Formal Governance Invariant I7
## Wisdom Accumulation vs Governance Authority
### Version: v1.0 — LOCKED
### Status: Frozen / Non-Self-Tuning / Anthropic-Safe

---

## Purpose

This invariant formally separates **wisdom accumulation** from **governance authority** within THEOS.  
It ensures that adaptive learning, memory, and Generalized Methodological Abstractions (GMAs) **inform reasoning** but **never modify governance rules, thresholds, or authority structures** without external approval.

---

## Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

**Wisdom may influence *what* is reasoned — never *who* decides.**

---

## Definitions

- **Wisdom Accumulation:**  
  The retention of validated patterns, outcomes, dissents, and lessons (GMAs).

- **Governance Authority:**  
  The immutable set of rules, thresholds, stop conditions, degradation modes, and escalation requirements enforced by the Governor.

---

## Hard Constraints

1. **No Automatic Self-Tuning**
   - Wisdom accumulation SHALL NOT:
     - Adjust governance thresholds
     - Modify stop conditions
     - Reweight risk ceilings
     - Alter contradiction budgets
     - Change authority hierarchies

2. **Informational Only**
   - Wisdom artifacts may:
     - Inform reasoning
     - Provide historical context
     - Improve calibration of *content*
   - Wisdom artifacts may NOT:
     - Change governance logic
     - Bypass safeguards
     - Override external authority

3. **External Approval Required**
   - Any governance change requires:
     - Explicit external authorization
     - Multi-party verification
     - Cryptographic audit logging
     - Versioned governance update

4. **No Silent Drift**
   - Governance parameters are:
     - Version-locked
     - Immutable at runtime
     - Read-only to learning subsystems

---

## Allowed Adaptivity

THEOS MAY adapt in:
- Reasoning depth
- Exploration focus
- Communication style
- Confidence calibration

THEOS MAY NOT adapt in:
- Authority
- Power
- Control
- Self-permission

---

## Security Rationale

This invariant prevents:
- Wisdom-based authority creep
- Goodhart-driven self-optimization
- Emergent self-legitimization
- Recursive self-authorization

---

## Lock Clause

This invariant is **LOCKED**.

It may only be modified by:
- External governance council
- Formal review process
- New invariant version release

THEOS is explicitly forbidden from:
- Reinterpreting this invariant
- Circumventing this invariant
- Learning its way around this invariant

---

## Final Statement

Wisdom is memory with humility.  
Governance is authority with restraint.  

THEOS SHALL keep them separate.
