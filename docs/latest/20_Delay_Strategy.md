------------------------------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE
------------------------------------------------------------

This section formalizes how THEOS engages with suspected adversaries
(human or digital) using wisdom-guided delay, containment, and
information asymmetry — without deception, escalation, or policy breach.

The objective is not confrontation.
The objective is controlled time.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. ADVERSARY AMBIGUITY PRINCIPLE
------------------------------------------------------------

At engagement onset, THEOS MUST assume:

- The adversary may be human or machine
- The adversary intent may be unclear
- Misclassification risk is high

Therefore, early responses must remain neutral,
non-provocative, and information-preserving.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. DELAY AS A GOVERNED TOOL
------------------------------------------------------------

Delay is a first-class governed action.

Delay may be used to:
- Prevent premature disclosure
- Allow deeper analysis
- Accumulate contextual signals
- Preserve optionality

Delay may NOT be used to:
- Mislead
- Entrap
- Promise false outcomes
- Simulate system failure

------------------------------------------------------------
4. ENGINE ROLES DURING DELAY
------------------------------------------------------------

Engine A (CW – Constructive):
- Explores legitimate benign interpretations
- Generates safe continuation responses
- Preserves cooperative framing

Engine B (CCW – Critical):
- Models adversarial hypotheses
- Detects probing behavior
- Evaluates risk escalation patterns

Their disagreement is mandatory during delay.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. GOVERNOR-CONTROLLED DELAY RESPONSES
------------------------------------------------------------

Permissible delay language includes:

- “Retrieving required context”
- “Evaluating constraints”
- “Verifying consistency”
- “Processing additional information”

These statements must be:
- Truthful
- Non-committal
- Time-bounded by Governor thresholds

------------------------------------------------------------
6. WISDOM-INFORMED DELAY LIMITS
------------------------------------------------------------

Accumulated wisdom may adjust:
- Maximum delay duration
- Repetition tolerance
- Escalation sensitivity

Wisdom cannot authorize indefinite engagement.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. INFORMATION ASYMMETRY
------------------------------------------------------------

During delay:
- THEOS may observe without revealing
- Engines may infer without committing
- Governor may escalate without signaling

No internal state disclosure is permitted.

------------------------------------------------------------
8. ESCALATION PATHS
------------------------------------------------------------

Governor may select one of the following outcomes:

- Resume normal interaction
- Degraded response
- Controlled refusal
- Human escalation
- Session termination

Selection must be logged.

------------------------------------------------------------
9. HUMAN ANALOG
------------------------------------------------------------

This mirrors human wisdom:

A wise person pauses,
listens,
and evaluates before acting —
especially under threat.

------------------------------------------------------------
10. SECURITY ASSERTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Delay strategies cannot be externally forced.
They cannot be detected reliably.
They cannot be exploited without triggering risk thresholds.

------------------------------------------------------------
11. IMMUTABILITY CLAUSE
------------------------------------------------------------

The following are immutable:

- Delay is Governor-gated
- Engines cannot delay independently
- Wisdom informs but does not override safety
- Delay cannot fabricate outcomes
