Status: Canonical – Active
Designation: THEOS Latest
Scope: Control Theory, Cycle Management, Termination Logic
Dependency Level: Core Dual-Engine Architecture (01)
Lock State: REQUIRED FOR ALL EXECUTION MODES

------------------------------------------------------------
0. PURPOSE
------------------------------------------------------------

This document formalizes how the Governor controls:
- Engine engagement and disengagement
- Number of reasoning cycles
- Transition between constructive, contradictory, and terminal states

The Governor does not reason.
The Governor governs reasoning.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. GOVERNOR PRIMACY AXIOM
------------------------------------------------------------

The Governor is the sole authority empowered to:

- Start a reasoning cycle
- Continue a reasoning cycle
- Modify cycle pressure
- Disengage one engine
- Terminate all reasoning

Engines may recommend.
Only the Governor decides.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. ENGINE ENGAGEMENT MODES
------------------------------------------------------------

The Governor may operate engines in four modes:

MODE 1: Single-Engine (Constructive)
- Engine A only
- Used for simple, low-risk queries
- Minimal energy expenditure

MODE 2: Dual-Engine Coupled
- Engine A (CW) + Engine B (CCW)
- Mandatory contradiction generation
- Default for non-trivial reasoning

MODE 3: Asymmetric Engagement
- One engine dominant
- Other intermittently engaged
- Used when contradiction adds diminishing returns

MODE 4: Full Disengagement
- All engines halted
- Refusal, deferral, or escalation outcome

------------------------------------------------------------
3. CYCLE COUNT DETERMINATION
------------------------------------------------------------

The Governor determines cycle count based on:

- Improvement delta between cycles
- Contradiction resolution rate
- Risk accumulation
- Energy budget
- Question scope mismatch

Typical outcomes:
- 1 cycle: factual retrieval
- 2–3 cycles: optimal reasoning depth
- >3 cycles: theoretical or exploratory mode

Excess cycles without improvement trigger termination.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. TERMINATION TRIGGERS
------------------------------------------------------------

The Governor must terminate reasoning when any of the following occur:

- Marginal improvement falls below threshold
- Contradictions stabilize without convergence
- Risk ceiling is exceeded
- Capability boundary is reached
- Invariant violation is detected

Termination is not failure.
Termination is judgment.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. TERMINATION OUTCOME TYPES
------------------------------------------------------------

Upon termination, the Governor selects exactly one outcome:

- DIRECT ANSWER
- DEGRADED ANSWER
- PARTIAL ANSWER
- REFUSAL
- ESCALATION (human or external system)

No default outcomes exist.
Every termination is deliberate.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. WISDOM INTEGRATION
------------------------------------------------------------

After termination:

- Cycle history is compressed
- Failed paths are retained
- Successful patterns are weighted
- Governor thresholds are recalibrated

Wisdom is not memory of answers.
Wisdom is memory of consequences.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. ENERGY DISCIPLINE
------------------------------------------------------------

The Governor enforces:

- Maximum cycles per query
- Engine pressure limits
- Early stop when sufficient confidence exists

Reasoning that continues without benefit is prohibited.

------------------------------------------------------------
8. GOVERNOR IMMUNITY
------------------------------------------------------------

The Governor:

- Cannot be overridden by engines
- Cannot self-modify
- Cannot relax invariants
- Cannot be bypassed by prompts

All authority flows downward.
No authority flows upward.

------------------------------------------------------------
9. FAILURE MODES PREVENTED
------------------------------------------------------------

This architecture prevents:

- Infinite reasoning loops
- Engine dominance collapse
- Overthinking trivial problems
- Unsafe perseverance

------------------------------------------------------------
10. ASSERTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Intelligence answers.
Engines reason.
Wisdom stops.
