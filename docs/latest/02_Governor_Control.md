## 1. Purpose of the Governor

The Governor is **not a reasoning engine**.

The Governor:
- Does not perform inductive, abductive, or deductive reasoning
- Does not generate answers
- Does not evaluate truth directly

The Governor exists solely to **control, modulate, and constrain** the operation of the dual contradictory reasoning engines defined in THEOS Latest 01.

> Without dual engines producing contradiction, the Governor has nothing to govern.

## 2. Conceptual Role: Clutch, Transmission, and Pressure Controller

The Governor functions analogously to a mechanical transmission system:

- **Clutch**: Engages or disengages Engine B (counter-rotating)
- **Gear Ratio**: Adjusts contradiction pressure between engines
- **Brake**: Stops further cycles when diminishing returns are detected
- **Selector**: Chooses outcome mode (Direct, Degraded, Refusal)

The Governor does **not** decide *what* to think.  
It decides **how long**, **how hard**, and **under what constraints** thinking occurs.

---

## 3. Cycle Control

Each engine executes triadic reasoning cycles:

- Engine A (CW): Inductive → Abductive → Deductive
- Engine B (CCW): Inductive → Deductive → Abductive (reverse traversal)

The Governor controls:
- Number of full cycles permitted
- Whether both engines run simultaneously
- Whether Engine B is lifted (disengaged) temporarily
- Whether additional refinement cycles are allowed

Default behavior:
- 1–2 cycles for low-stakes queries
- 2–3 cycles for complex or high-stakes queries
- Hard stop when refinement gain falls below threshold

---

## 4. Contradiction Torque

Contradiction is treated as a **controlled resource**, not a side effect.

The Governor monitors:
- Degree of disagreement between engines
- Stability of conclusions across cycles
- Novelty introduced by additional passes

Excessive contradiction without convergence triggers:
- Engine B disengagement
- Pressure reduction
- Or early termination with degraded output

---

## 5. Stop, Degrade, Refuse Logic

The Governor enforces explicit stop conditions:

- **STOP**: Convergence reached, further cycles add no value
- **DEGRADE**: Uncertainty remains, but risk prohibits deeper reasoning
- **REFUSE**: Premise invalid, unsafe, or epistemically unanswerable

These outcomes are **governance decisions**, not reasoning failures.

---

## 6. Wisdom Accumulation Boundary

Wisdom accumulation does **not** occur inside the Governor.

The Governor:
- Tags cycle outcomes
- Records stop conditions
- Logs contradiction patterns

Wisdom artifacts (GMAs) are extracted **after** governance completes and stored separately.

---

## 7. Non-Negotiable Invariant

The Governor may never:
- Alter reasoning rules mid-cycle
- Inject new assumptions
- Override engine outputs

Its authority is **procedural**, not cognitive.

## 8. Dependency Declaration

This document is invalid without:
- THEOS Latest 01 — Core Dual Engine Architecture

Any governance, safety, or hardening document that does not reference both
Latest 01 and Latest 02 is incomplete by definition.
