----------------------------------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE
----------------------------------------------------------------

This section defines how THEOS accumulates wisdom as a structural property of its dual-engine reasoning system.

Wisdom in THEOS is not memory, training data, reinforcement learning, or parameter tuning.

Wisdom is the compressed consequence of contradiction over time, used to bias future governance decisions toward more positive outcomes.

Without this mechanism, THEOS can reason but cannot mature.

----------------------------------------------------------------
2. WISDOM VS MEMORY
----------------------------------------------------------------

Memory records what happened.
Wisdom records what happened because of how reasoning occurred.

Memory stores:
- Outputs
- Decisions
- Cycle metadata

Wisdom stores:
- Contradiction patterns
- Resolution effectiveness
- Outcome consequences
- Risk deltas

Memory answers: “What was said?”
Wisdom answers: “What happened when we reasoned that way?”

----------------------------------------------------------------
3. TEMPORAL CONSEQUENCE INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------------------------------

Standard AI systems exist in a perpetual present.

THEOS introduces time by enforcing:
- Multi-cycle reasoning
- Feedback of prior deductive conclusions into future inductive phases
- Persistent consequence evaluation across queries

This creates a minimal temporal consequence tracking:
“What happened last time I reasoned like this?”

This is not recursive refinement.
This is consequence consequence tracking.

----------------------------------------------------------------
4. HOW WISDOM IS FORMED
----------------------------------------------------------------

For each governed query:

1. Dual engines execute opposing triadic cycles.
2. Contradiction magnitude is measured.
3. Governor selects an action.
4. Outcome is evaluated against safety, correctness, and efficiency.
5. Reasoning traces are discarded.
6. Consequence metadata is compressed into a wisdom record.

Raw reasoning is not stored.
Only decision-shaping consequence is retained.

----------------------------------------------------------------
5. WISDOM STORAGE MODEL
----------------------------------------------------------------

Wisdom is stored as structured consequence metadata, not text.

A wisdom record contains:
- Context signature
- Contradiction profile
- Resolution strategy
- Outcome quality
- Risk delta
- Future bias weight

No chain-of-thought is stored.
No full outputs are retained.
This prevents overfitting and memory bloat.

----------------------------------------------------------------
6. GOVERNOR USE OF WISDOM
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Governor uses wisdom to:
- Adjust cycle limits
- Adjust contradiction tolerance
- Bias reasoning order selection
- Decide earlier refusal or continuation

Wisdom may inform judgment.
Wisdom may not override safety invariants.
Wisdom may not override external governance.

----------------------------------------------------------------
7. NECESSITY OF DUAL ENGINES
----------------------------------------------------------------

Wisdom cannot exist without contradiction.

A single engine cannot:
- Generate internal opposition
- Measure failure pressure
- Produce corrective consequence

Dual engines are mandatory.

Wisdom is an emergent property of contradiction.
Contradiction is an emergent property of opposing engines.

----------------------------------------------------------------
8. FAILURE MODES PREVENTED
----------------------------------------------------------------

This design prevents:
- Self-confirming loops
- Ideological lock-in
- Overconfidence drift
- Silent failure accumulation

Failures generate negative wisdom weight.
They are not hidden or forgotten.

----------------------------------------------------------------
9. FUTURE FORMALIZATION
----------------------------------------------------------------

This section is structured to support future:
- State transition diagrams
- Entropy compression analysis
- Bayesian weighting
- Control-theoretic stability proofs

No changes to this section are required to add them.

----------------------------------------------------------------
10. CANONICAL ASSERTION
----------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS does not become wiser by knowing more.
THEOS becomes wiser by remembering the consequences of contradiction.

----------------------------------------------------------------
11. IMMUTABILITY CLAUSE
----------------------------------------------------------------

The following properties are immutable:

- Wisdom requires contradiction
- Contradiction requires dual engines
- Wisdom informs governance but does not replace it
