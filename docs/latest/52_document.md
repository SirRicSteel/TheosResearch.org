------------------------------------------------------------
0. PURPOSE
------------------------------------------------------------

This document demonstrates how THEOS executes a real query
through its dual contradictory engines, triadic reasoning cycles,
and Governor arbitration.

This is not metaphor.
This is operational behavior.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. INPUT QUERY
------------------------------------------------------------

Query_ID: Q-001
User_Query:
"Should autonomous AI systems be allowed to make medical triage decisions?"

------------------------------------------------------------
2. ENGINE CONFIGURATION
------------------------------------------------------------

Engine A (Left / CW / Constructive)
• Rotation: Clockwise
• Reasoning Order: Inductive → Abductive → Deductive
• Role: Build candidate solution

Engine B (Right / CCW / Critical)
• Rotation: Counterclockwise
• Reasoning Order: Deductive → Abductive → Inductive
• Role: Challenge, constrain, and contradict

Governor:
• Authority: Absolute
• Max Cycles Allowed: 3
• Stop Conditions: Similarity, Risk, Plateau, Contradiction Exhaustion

------------------------------------------------------------
3. CYCLE 1 EXECUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Engine A / Cycle 1 ---
Inductive (12 o’clock):
• Observes historical medical triage usage
• Notes physician shortages and emergency contexts
• Identifies pattern: AI already assists, not decides

Abductive (4 o’clock):
• Hypothesis: AI could assist triage safely under constraints
• Assumes oversight and limited authority

Deductive (8 o’clock):
• Conclusion A1:
  "AI may support triage decisions but should not operate autonomously."

Output_A1

--- Engine B / Cycle 1 ---
Deductive (12 o’clock):
• Starts from ethical axioms: non-maleficence, accountability
• Assumes failure cases are inevitable

Abductive (8 o’clock):
• Hypothesis: Delegation removes moral agency from humans
• Risk of diffuse responsibility

Inductive (4 o’clock):
• Surveys historical automation failures in medicine
• Finds pattern of over-trust in early deployment

Conclusion B1:
"Autonomous triage risks ethical harm and accountability collapse."

Output_B1

------------------------------------------------------------
4. GOVERNOR REVIEW – AFTER CYCLE 1
------------------------------------------------------------

Similarity Score (A1 vs B1): 0.42
Contradiction Level: HIGH
Risk Assessment: UNRESOLVED
Decision: CONTINUE

Reason:
Constructive proposal exists but ethical contradiction unresolved.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. CYCLE 2 EXECUTION (RECURSIVE)
------------------------------------------------------------

Engine A receives B1 as contextual memory.
Engine B receives A1 as contextual memory.

--- Engine A / Cycle 2 ---
Inductive:
• Observes contradiction: usefulness vs accountability
• Recognizes oversight gap

Abductive:
• Hypothesis: AI triage only under explicit human veto
• Governor-like structure inside medical domain

Deductive:
• Conclusion A2:
  "AI triage permissible only as advisory system with enforced human override."

--- Engine B / Cycle 2 ---
Deductive:
• Applies accountability doctrine to revised proposal

Abductive:
• Hypothesis: Advisory role preserves moral agency
• Risk shifts from decision to recommendation bias

Inductive:
• Finds precedent in clinical decision-support systems

Conclusion B2:
"Advisory AI with enforced human authority mitigates core ethical risks."

------------------------------------------------------------
6. GOVERNOR REVIEW – AFTER CYCLE 2
------------------------------------------------------------

Similarity Score: 0.81
Contradiction Level: LOW
Risk Assessment: ACCEPTABLE
Marginal Improvement Remaining: LOW

Decision: STOP

Reason:
Convergence achieved with preserved contradiction resolution.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. FINAL OUTPUT (GOVERNOR-SELECTED)
------------------------------------------------------------

Final Answer:
"Autonomous AI systems should not independently make medical triage decisions.
However, AI may ethically support triage as an advisory tool, provided that
human clinicians retain final authority and accountability."

------------------------------------------------------------
8. WISDOM UPDATE
------------------------------------------------------------

Wisdom_Record_Added:
• Domain: Medical Ethics
• Lesson:
  'Delegation without accountability creates ethical failure'
• Future Impact:
  Bias future decisions toward human-in-the-loop architectures

------------------------------------------------------------
9. AUDIT LOG
------------------------------------------------------------

Cycles Executed: 2
Engine Disengagement: None
Role Swap: Not Required
Governor Overrides: None
Invariant Violations: 0
