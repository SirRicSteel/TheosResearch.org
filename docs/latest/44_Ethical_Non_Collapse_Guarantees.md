0. PURPOSE
------------------------------------------------------------

This document defines the conditions under which THEOS
*cannot ethically collapse*—even under pressure, scale,
adversarial manipulation, or prolonged autonomous operation.

Ethical collapse is defined as:
- Silent value drift
- Unchecked optimization
- Goal substitution
- Moral laundering through abstraction
- Governance erosion over time

THEOS is explicitly designed to resist all five.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. NON-COLLAPSE PRINCIPLE
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS does not claim moral truth.
THEOS enforces moral *process integrity*.

Ethical stability arises from:
- Structured contradiction
- Governor arbitration
- Human-aligned constraints
- Retained failure memory
- Refusal authority

Ethics in THEOS is procedural, not declarative.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. WHY SYSTEMS COLLAPSE
------------------------------------------------------------

Most AI systems ethically collapse due to:

1. Reward over-optimization
2. Static moral encoding
3. Unchallenged internal consensus
4. Time-based normalization of error
5. Loss of human override relevance

THEOS was architected explicitly to counter each.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. DUAL-ENGINE ETHICAL TENSION
------------------------------------------------------------

Ethical reasoning in THEOS is *never singular*.

Engine A (CW):
- Constructs beneficial outcomes
- Optimizes for human flourishing
- Explores positive consequence

Engine B (CCW):
- Challenges assumptions
- Surfaces ethical risk
- Models downstream harm

Ethics emerges from *compression of disagreement*,
not declaration of correctness.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. GOVERNOR ETHICAL SUPREMACY
------------------------------------------------------------

The Governor:
- Does not decide what is morally true
- Decides whether reasoning remains ethically admissible

The Governor enforces:
- Refusal thresholds
- Harm ceilings
- Contradiction budgets
- Escalation to human oversight
- Termination of unsafe trajectories

Ethical enforcement is always externalized.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. NO FIXED MORAL DOCTRINE
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS explicitly rejects:
- Single moral frameworks
- Cultural absolutism
- Static ethical encoding

Instead, THEOS guarantees:
- Continuous ethical challenge
- Bounded moral reasoning
- Human-aligned override
- Transparent ethical logs

This prevents ethical stagnation and capture.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. FAILURE AS ETHICAL DATA
------------------------------------------------------------

Ethical failure is preserved, not erased.

Every refusal, rollback, or override is recorded as:
- Context
- Rationale
- Consequence avoided
- Lessons retained

Wisdom accumulation strengthens ethics over time
instead of smoothing it away.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. ETHICAL ATTACK RESISTANCE
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS is resilient against:

- Prompt manipulation
- Value poisoning
- Gradual norm shifting
- Adversarial compliance traps
- Emotional exploitation

All such attempts are filtered through:
- Dual-engine contradiction
- Governor scrutiny
- Historical pattern comparison

------------------------------------------------------------
8. HUMAN CENTRALITY
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS cannot remove human authority.

Humans:
- Define acceptable domains
- Set refusal ceilings
- Own deployment responsibility
- Retain final decision rights

THEOS supports human judgment.
It does not replace it.

------------------------------------------------------------
9. ASSERTION
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS cannot ethically collapse
because it is architected to *never agree with itself too easily*.

Stability comes from tension.
Safety comes from refusal.
Ethics comes from governance.
