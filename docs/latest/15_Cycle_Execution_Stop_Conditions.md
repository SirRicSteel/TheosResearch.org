----------------------------------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE
----------------------------------------------------------------

This section defines how the Governor actively controls:
- Cycle count
- Engine engagement
- Role switching
- Disengagement
- Termination
- Refusal

The Governor is not advisory.
It is authoritative.

No engine may continue reasoning without Governor authorization.

----------------------------------------------------------------
2. GOVERNOR ROLE
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Governor functions as a selector, regulator, and arbiter.

It does not generate solutions.
It governs how solutions are generated.

Its authority applies across:
- Single-engine execution
- Dual-engine execution
- Cycle continuation
- Engine disengagement
- Engine role swapping
- Final output selection

----------------------------------------------------------------
3. CYCLE EXECUTION CONTROL
----------------------------------------------------------------

For each query, the Governor determines:

- Whether to run:
  - Left engine only
  - Dual engines simultaneously
- Initial cycle count allowance
- Maximum allowable cycles
- Whether additional cycles provide marginal value

The Governor may stop after:
- One cycle
- Two cycles
- N cycles
based on outcome quality and diminishing returns.

----------------------------------------------------------------
4. ENGINE ENGAGEMENT STATES
----------------------------------------------------------------

Each engine may exist in one of four states:

- ENGAGED
- DISENGAGED
- SUSPENDED
- TERMINATED

The Governor may:
- Lift an engine out of mesh
- Re-engage it later
- Allow asymmetric reasoning
- Force symmetry when required

This functions as a conceptual clutch system.

----------------------------------------------------------------
5. STOP CONDITIONS (AUTHORITATIVE)
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Governor may halt reasoning when any condition is met:

- Similarity convergence exceeds threshold
- Contradiction budget is exhausted
- Marginal improvement falls below epsilon
- Risk ceiling is exceeded
- Capability boundary is detected
- External governance constraint applies

Stopping is a governed success condition, not failure.

----------------------------------------------------------------
6. OUTCOME MODES
----------------------------------------------------------------

Upon stopping, the Governor selects exactly one outcome mode:

- DIRECT ANSWER
- DEGRADED ANSWER
- REFUSAL WITH CORRECTIVE INFORMATION

Engines do not select outcomes.
The Governor does.

----------------------------------------------------------------
7. ENGINE ROLE SWAPPING (OPTIONAL)
----------------------------------------------------------------

If contradiction stagnates or bias is detected, the Governor may:

- Swap reasoning roles between engines
- Reverse triadic order assignment
- Allow one additional bounded cycle

Role swapping is:
- Rare
- Logged
- Limited per query
- Never automatic

----------------------------------------------------------------
8. WISDOM-INFORMED GOVERNANCE
----------------------------------------------------------------

Past wisdom may bias:
- Early stopping
- Earlier refusal
- Reduced cycle allowance
- Increased scrutiny

Wisdom informs governance.
It does not override safety invariants.

----------------------------------------------------------------
9. FAILURE PREVENTION
----------------------------------------------------------------

This orchestration prevents:

- Infinite loops
- Overthinking
- Overconfidence
- Latent runaway reasoning
- Hidden assumption lock-in

The Governor enforces proportional reasoning.

----------------------------------------------------------------
10. HUMAN ANALOG
----------------------------------------------------------------

This mirrors human judgment:

- Think once → decide
- Think again → refine
- Think too long → stop

Knowing when to stop is wisdom.

----------------------------------------------------------------
11. CANONICAL ASSERTION
----------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS does not reason until it is correct.
THEOS reasons until further reasoning is no longer justified.

----------------------------------------------------------------
12. IMMUTABILITY CLAUSE
----------------------------------------------------------------

The following are immutable:

- Governor authority is absolute
- Engines may not self-continue
- All stops are intentional
- All outcomes are selected
