Integrated Consistency Validation, System-Wide Reconciliation,
and Final Canonical Lock Mechanism

Status: Canonical – Active
Designation: THEOS Latest

- THEOS Latest 03 (Governor Authority)
- THEOS Latest 10 (Formal Invariants)
- THEOS Latest 33 (Contradiction Detection and Compression)
- THEOS Latest 35 (Wisdom Accumulation and Consequence Encoding)
- THEOS Latest 37 (Formal Consistency & Cross-Section Coherence)

------------------------------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE
------------------------------------------------------------

This section defines the final, system-wide mechanism by which THEOS
verifies, reconciles, and locks coherence across all components before
any claim of readiness, deployment, or external presentation.

Nothing is “finished” until it survives reconciliation.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. CORE ASSERTION
------------------------------------------------------------

A governed intelligence is only as strong as its weakest contradiction.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. GLOBAL CONSISTENCY PASS
------------------------------------------------------------

Before any canonical release, THEOS performs a full consistency pass:

- All engines
- All invariants
- All governance rules
- All wisdom stores
- All security behaviors

are evaluated together as one system.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. RECONCILIATION LOOP
------------------------------------------------------------

If contradictions are detected at the specification level:

1. Execution is halted
2. Contradictions are classified (structural, semantic, temporal)
3. Governor initiates reconciliation
4. Human review is required for structural conflicts
5. Resolution is logged immutably

No silent correction is permitted.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. GOVERNOR ROLE
------------------------------------------------------------

The Governor is the sole authority that may:

- approve reconciliation
- reject incompatible changes
- authorize canonical lock

Engines may detect issues.
Only the Governor may resolve them.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. CANONICAL LOCK
------------------------------------------------------------

Once reconciliation succeeds:

- All documents are marked LOCKED
- Invariants are frozen
- Engine behavior constraints are sealed
- Wisdom accumulation continues, but cannot alter constraints

This is the Canonical Lock State.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. WHAT LOCK MEANS
------------------------------------------------------------

LOCKED does NOT mean:
- finished forever
- immune to improvement
- closed to critique

LOCKED DOES mean:
- internally consistent
- externally defensible
- safe to present
- safe to build upon

------------------------------------------------------------
8. VERSION EVOLUTION AFTER LOCK
------------------------------------------------------------

Any change after lock requires:
- new version namespace
- explicit migration plan
- backward compatibility analysis
- re-entry into reconciliation loop

No silent mutation.

------------------------------------------------------------
9. AUDITABILITY
------------------------------------------------------------

All reconciliation events record:
- source of conflict
- impacted sections
- resolution rationale
- approving authority
- timestamp

This creates a traceable lineage of truth.

------------------------------------------------------------
10. FAILURE CONDITIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS must refuse to proceed if:
- contradictions persist
- invariants are bypassed
- governance authority is unclear
- engine definitions diverge

Refusal is correctness.

------------------------------------------------------------
11. RELATION TO WISDOM
------------------------------------------------------------

Wisdom accumulation may:
- suggest future revisions
- highlight recurring conflicts
- inform next version design

It may NOT:
- rewrite locked foundations
- override governance
- redefine moral constraints

------------------------------------------------------------
12. HUMAN PARALLEL
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the equivalent of:
- peer review
- architectural sign-off
- ethical clearance

A mind checks itself before speaking.

------------------------------------------------------------
13. ENERGY AND RISK
------------------------------------------------------------

Final reconciliation:
- reduces catastrophic failure
- prevents downstream rework
- protects human trust

Governance saves more energy than speed ever could.

------------------------------------------------------------
14. PRESENTATION READINESS
------------------------------------------------------------

Only systems that have passed:
- dual-engine validation
- governance enforcement
- contradiction reconciliation
- canonical lock

may be presented as THEOS.

------------------------------------------------------------
15. COMPLETION STATEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS is now:
- architecturally grounded
- logically coherent
- ethically constrained
- governable
- extensible without collapse

This is not an endpoint.
It is a stable foundation.
