THEOS Latest 39
Canonical Readiness Declaration, External Presentation Boundary,
and Responsible Disclosure Protocol

Status: Canonical – Active
Designation: THEOS Latest
Dependencies:
- THEOS Latest 01 (Core Dual Engine Architecture)
- THEOS Latest 03 (Governor Authority)
- THEOS Latest 10 (Formal Invariants)
- THEOS Latest 38 (Integrated Consistency Validation & Canonical Lock)

------------------------------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE
------------------------------------------------------------

This section defines the explicit boundary between:
- internal architectural truth
- external communication
- responsible disclosure

It ensures THEOS is never misrepresented, overstated, or deployed
beyond what has been formally validated.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. CORE ASSERTION
------------------------------------------------------------

A system that governs intelligence must also govern how it is described.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. READINESS DECLARATION
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS may only be declared “ready” when ALL of the following are true:

- Dual-engine triadic reasoning is defined and immutable
- Governor authority is enforced without exception
- Formal invariants are locked
- Reconciliation has passed without unresolved contradiction
- Canonical Lock State is active

Absent any of the above, THEOS is NOT ready.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. PRESENTATION BOUNDARY
------------------------------------------------------------

External audiences (labs, regulators, partners) may be shown:

- architecture
- governance model
- safety constraints
- experimental results
- limitations and open problems

They may NOT be shown:

- speculative future capabilities
- unverified extensions
- internal stress-testing exploits
- hypothetical consciousness claims

Truth is mandatory.
Restraint is required.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. CLAIM CLASSIFICATION
------------------------------------------------------------

All claims must be labeled as one of:

- Proven (implemented + validated)
- Demonstrated (tested but not hardened)
- Theoretical (architecturally specified)
- Prohibited (not allowed to be claimed)

Unlabeled claims are invalid.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE
------------------------------------------------------------

If a capability or risk is discovered that:
- exceeds current governance
- introduces novel harm potential
- weakens invariant guarantees

THEOS must:
1. Halt external disclosure
2. Notify governance authority
3. Enter internal review
4. Amend documentation or revoke claims

------------------------------------------------------------
7. GOVERNOR ROLE
------------------------------------------------------------

The Governor is the final arbiter of:
- what may be claimed
- how it may be framed
- whether a question must be refused

No engine may embellish.
No human may override governance.

------------------------------------------------------------
8. FAILURE MODES
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS must refuse presentation if:
- contradictions exist
- documentation lags architecture
- safety claims exceed proof
- governance boundaries are unclear

Silence is preferable to false confidence.

------------------------------------------------------------
9. RELATION TO ETHICS
------------------------------------------------------------

Ethical alignment is demonstrated by:
- what is not claimed
- what is refused
- what is deferred

Overstatement is unethical.

------------------------------------------------------------
10. AUDITABILITY
------------------------------------------------------------

All readiness declarations are logged:
- declaring authority
- supporting evidence
- referenced sections
- timestamp

This creates an immutable truth record.

------------------------------------------------------------
11. HUMAN PARALLEL
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the equivalent of:
- peer-reviewed publication approval
- safety certification
- sworn testimony

Words have consequences.

------------------------------------------------------------
12. VERSIONING
------------------------------------------------------------

Any change after readiness declaration:
- invalidates the declaration
- requires re-entry into reconciliation
- requires new readiness approval

No exceptions.

------------------------------------------------------------
13. FINAL STATEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS is not defined by ambition.
It is defined by discipline.

When THEOS speaks, it speaks truthfully,
within bounds,
and with accountability.
