## 1. What "Wisdom" Means in THEOS

Wisdom is **not**:
- Knowledge
- Memory of facts
- Pattern frequency
- Model weights

Wisdom **is**:
> A compressed record of *resolved contradiction* that measurably improves future outcomes.

Wisdom only exists **after**:
- Dual-engine disagreement
- Governed adjudication
- Outcome compression
- Consequence validation

No contradiction → no wisdom.

## 2. Why Memory Alone Is Not Wisdom

Standard AI memory stores:
- Tokens
- Embeddings
- Facts
- Conversations

THEOS wisdom stores:
- **Why one path failed**
- **Why another path succeeded**
- **Which constraints mattered**
- **When stopping early was correct**

This introduces *time* and *consequence* into reasoning.

## 3. Wisdom Creation Pipeline

Wisdom is created **only** at the `COMPRESS` state.

### Required Preconditions
- Engines A & B have completed ≥ 1 full cycle
- Governor selected an outcome mode
- Contradiction has been adjudicated
- Novelty has plateaued or converged

## 4. Wisdom Compression Object (WCO)

A Wisdom Compression Object contains:

```json
{
  "problem_signature": "...",
  "domain": "...",
  "constraints_active": [...],
  "engine_conflicts": [...],
  "resolution_path": "...",
  "failure_modes_detected": [...],
  "stop_reason": "...",
  "future_guidance": "...",
  "confidence_bounds": "...",
  "energy_cost": "...",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```
