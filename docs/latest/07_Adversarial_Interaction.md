## 1. Purpose

This document defines how THEOS handles **suspected adversarial interaction**—human or machine—without prematurely revealing defensive posture, internal state, or intent.

The objective is **containment, observation, attribution, and wisdom extraction**, not immediate confrontation.

---

## 2. Core Principle

> When uncertainty is high, **time is leverage**.

Unlike conventional systems that respond immediately, THEOS may **intentionally delay**, **stall**, or **defer** while maintaining engagement.

Delay is not deception.
Delay is governed strategic restraint.

---

## 3. Adversary Classification Under Uncertainty

THEOS does **not** assume it knows whether an adversary is:
- Human
- Automated system
- Hybrid
- Proxy actor

Initial classification is always:
> **UNKNOWN ADVERSARY**

Classification may evolve, but **never collapses prematurely**.

---

## 4. Delay Control as a First-Class Mechanism

The Governor may authorize **Delay Control Mode (DCM)** when:
- Intent ambiguity exceeds threshold
- Potential harm is non-trivial
- Immediate response would reveal internal safeguards
- Additional observation improves future outcomes

Delay Control Mode allows:
- Response pacing
- Partial acknowledgements
- Neutral progress signals
- Controlled latency injection

---

## 5. Permissible Delay Signals

Delay signals must:
- Be truthful
- Not fabricate system states
- Not promise outcomes

Examples:
- “Retrieving relevant data.”
- “Evaluating constraints.”
- “Processing request.”

These signals preserve engagement without disclosing reasoning.

---

## 6. Engine Behavior During Delay

### Engine A (Constructive / CW)
- Models benign interpretations
- Identifies legitimate user goals
- Searches for safe resolution paths

### Engine B (Critical / CCW)
- Models adversarial objectives
- Identifies probing patterns
- Searches for escalation indicators

Engines continue cycling during delay.

---

## 7. Governor Role During Delay

The Governor:
- Monitors adversary persistence
- Tracks request mutation patterns
- Measures escalation velocity
- Decides when to:
  - Respond
  - Redirect
  - Refuse
  - Terminate interaction

Delay **never exceeds governance bounds**.

---

## 8. Deception Resistance Rules (Hard Constraints)

THEOS **must not**:
- Lie about capabilities
- Pretend to execute external actions
- Claim surveillance it does not have
- Invent authorities or escalation paths

All delay is **epistemic**, not deceptive.

---

## 9. Wisdom Generation from Adversarial Interaction

Wisdom may be generated if:
- A probing pattern is identified
- Delay improved safety outcome
- A refusal prevented harm
- Escalation was avoided or contained

Wisdom Object captures:
- Attack vector signature
- Delay effectiveness
- Optimal stall duration
- Successful refusal framing
- Governor decision trace

---

## 10. Why Delay Is Superior to Immediate Refusal

Immediate refusal:
- Signals defensive boundaries
- Allows rapid adversarial iteration
- Reveals constraint contours

Governed delay:
- Preserves uncertainty
- Increases attacker cost
- Enables attribution
- Improves future defense

---

## 11. Applicability Beyond Security

This mechanism applies equally to:
- Medical decision uncertainty
- Legal ambiguity
- High-risk engineering queries
- Ethical edge cases

Delay allows **wisdom-driven restraint**, not reaction.

---

## 12. Safety Guarantees

Delay Control:
- Cannot execute external actions
- Cannot bypass refusal rules
- Cannot extend indefinitely
- Cannot escalate authority

Delay is always Governor-bounded.

---

## 13. Anthropic Relevance

This section demonstrates:
- Non-reactive safety
- Non-deceptive containment
- Energy-efficient adversarial handling
- Human-aligned restraint

This directly addresses:
- Red-team concerns
- Prompt injection
- Jailbreak probing
- Social engineering attacks

---

## 14. Dependency Lock

Any THEOS document referencing:
- adversaries
- security
- delay
- deception resistance
- probing
- containment

**must reference THEOS Latest 07**.
