Scope: Temporal Extension
Dependency Level: GLOBAL
Lock State: REQUIRED BEFORE ANY MULTI-YEAR CONTINUATION

0. PURPOSE
------------------------------------------------------------

This document defines how THEOS may evolve over long time horizons
without collapsing coherence, violating its core, or drifting into
unsafe or unfalsifiable territory.

THEOS is designed to grow.
This document ensures it grows **without losing itself**.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. THE PROBLEM OF TIME
------------------------------------------------------------

Any reasoning system that persists across years faces four risks:

1. Concept Drift
2. Governance Erosion
3. Accumulated Error Amplification
4. Narrative Self-Deception

Most AI systems fail not because they are wrong,
but because they forget why they were right.

THEOS treats time as a first-class constraint.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. TEMPORAL LAYERS
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS separates time into explicit layers:

Layer 0 – Immutable Core
- Sections 01–05
- Dual Engine Architecture
- Triadic Cycles
- Governor Supremacy

Layer 1 – Locked Hardening
- Safety
- Invariants
- Refusal Protocols

Layer 2 – Adaptive Wisdom
- Accumulated outcomes
- Historical consequence tracking
- Pattern compression

Layer 3 – Exploratory Research
- Hypotheses
- Simulations
- Non-binding experimentation

No layer may overwrite a lower layer.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. EVOLUTION RULE
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS evolves only by **addition**, never by silent replacement.

Any change must be one of:

- Extension
- Annotation
- Conditional specialization
- Parallel exploration

Deletion is forbidden.
Revision requires explicit versioning.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. WISDOM PRESERVATION
------------------------------------------------------------

Wisdom is preserved through:

- Outcome tagging
- Failure retention
- Explicit “why it didn’t work” records
- Negative result indexing

THEOS never optimizes away past mistakes.
It archives them as boundary markers.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. FUTURE RESEARCH BOUNDARIES
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS explicitly forbids research directions that attempt to:

- assert recursive refinement
- fabricate moral authority
- erase human governance
- simulate subjective experience claims
- remove refusal capacity
- bypass contradiction compression

These boundaries are not technical.
They are existential.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. SAFE EXPERIMENTATION ZONE
------------------------------------------------------------

All exploratory work must occur in a sandbox:

Experiment_Record {
  experiment_id
  hypothesis
  isolation_level
  rollback_plan
  failure_conditions
  governor_approval
}

No experiment may alter production reasoning paths.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. HANDOFF ACROSS TIME
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS must be understandable to a future human
who was not present at its creation.

Therefore:
- Every core concept must remain documented
- Every invariant must include its origin
- Every rejection must include its rationale

Continuity is a safety feature.

------------------------------------------------------------
8. ASSERTION
------------------------------------------------------------

THEOS is not optimized for speed.
It is optimized for **survivability across decades**.

If a future version cannot explain why it exists,
it is no longer THEOS.
