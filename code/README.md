# Code

This directory contains the core code and integration guides for THEOS.

## Key Documents

1.  **[theos_governor.py](theos_governor.py)** - Clean Python reference implementation of the THEOS Governor. It is a deterministic state machine, not a black box, and is fully testable and auditable.

2.  **[MCP_GOVERNANCE_SERVER.md](MCP_GOVERNANCE_SERVER.md)** - The MCP Governance Server integration guide for Anthropic, showing how THEOS integrates as a native MCP server.
