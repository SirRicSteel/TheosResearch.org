# THEOS — Classification Statement

THEOS (The Humanitarian & Ethical Operating System) is **not** a learning algorithm, model, or agent.

**Definition**

> THEOS is a deterministic, runtime governance mechanism that constrains, allocates, and audits intelligence produced by other systems.

THEOS:
- does not train models
- does not modify weights
- does not store prompts or chain-of-thought
- does not optimize reward functions
- does not define objectives or intent

Instead, THEOS governs **how intelligence is applied**:
- how much reasoning is permitted
- when adaptation is allowed
- what capabilities may be used
- when escalation, containment, or suspension must occur

This classification is intentional and foundational.
