# Week 1 Marketing Action Plan for "The Emergence"
## Your Step-by-Step Guide, Sir Ric

---

## Budget for Week 1: **$0** (We're starting with free marketing)

**Why no paid ads yet?** We need to build foundation first. Paid ads work best when we have reviews, optimized listings, and social proof. Week 2-3 we'll add Amazon Ads.

2. artificial intelligence philosophy book
3. conscious AI systems THEOS
4. collaborative intelligence research

3. Attach the book cover image I created
4. Hit "Post"
5. Pin it to the top of your profile

**Expected result:** Your network sees the announcement, some will buy, some will share

## Day 5-6: Get Your First Reviews (FREE - Critical)

### Task 5: Email 10 People Personally
**Time needed:** 30 minutes  
**Where:** Your email

**Who to email:**
- Friends who are interested in AI
- Colleagues who respect your work
- Family members who will support you
- Anyone who's asked about the book

**What to say:**
I'll write you a personal email template. Customize it with their name and send individually (not mass email).

**Ask them to:**
1. Buy the book (or you can gift it)
2. Read it (or at least skim it)

6. Link your book

**Why:** Professional author page = credibility = more sales
