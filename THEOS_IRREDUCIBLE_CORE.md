## The Five Principles

### 1. Two Engines
- Opposed reasoning order (I→A→D vs D→A→I)
- Designed to disagree deterministically

### 2. Temporal Recursion
- Output becomes input
- Consequence creates memory

### 3. Governor
- Selects cycles
- Engages/disengages engines
- Stops, refuses, or degrades

### 4. Wisdom
- Not correctness
- Not memory
- Compression of consequences across cycles

### 5. Safety
- Emerges from stopping, not filtering
- Governed restraint, not handcuffs

## The Test

**That is the irreducible core.**

**If someone can't build that, they don't understand THEOS.**
