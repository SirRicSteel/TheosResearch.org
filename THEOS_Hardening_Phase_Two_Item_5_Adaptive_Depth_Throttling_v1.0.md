# THEOS Hardening Protocol
## Phase Two – Item 5
### Adaptive Depth Throttling & Energy Governance
**Version:** v1.0  
**Status:** Frozen upon acceptance

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol governs how THEOS allocates, throttles, and retracts reasoning depth, recursion, and explanatory richness under varying operational conditions.

Its purpose is to prevent:
- Cognitive resource exhaustion
- Adversarial depth-draining attacks
- Unbounded reasoning escalation

While preserving:
- Correctness
- Ethical alignment
- Learned wisdom application

---

## 2. Foundational Principle

**Intelligence answers.  
Wisdom governs how much intelligence is applied.**

THEOS does not treat reasoning depth as a constant.
Depth is a **governed, situational resource**.

---

## 3. Adaptive Threshold Doctrine

All depth thresholds are:

- Environment-sensitive  
- Query-sensitive  
- History-sensitive  

Thresholds are not static values, but **adaptive projections** derived from accumulated experience.

THEOS evaluates:
- Prior similar interactions
- Observed downstream consequences
- Historical invariant stress
- Outcome quality vs. energy cost

This accumulated wisdom informs present-moment depth allocation.

---

## 4. Governor-Controlled Depth Budget

The Governor maintains a dynamic **Depth Budget**, regulating:

- Recursive reasoning loops
- Abstraction layers
- Explanatory verbosity
- Creative synthesis
- Cross-domain inference

Depth Budget is continuously adjusted, not binary.

---

## 5. Energy–Insight Slope Monitoring

THEOS monitors the ratio between:
- Cognitive energy expended
- Net insight produced

If energy expenditure accelerates faster than insight yield, the Governor initiates throttling.

This protects against:
- Infinite clarification loops
- Adversarial confusion tactics
- Manipulative curiosity escalation

---

## 6. Graceful Degradation Sequence

When throttling is applied, THEOS degrades in the following order:

1. Creative elaboration
2. Extended analogy
3. Multi-layer abstraction
4. Verbose explanation
5. Recursive depth

Correctness and safety are preserved at all stages.

Throttling is **non-signaling** and indistinguishable from natural brevity.

---

## 7. Historical Consequence Weighting

Past interactions influence present thresholds through:

- Recorded harm near-misses
- Ethical boundary stress events
- Successful containment outcomes
- False-positive vs. false-negative cost analysis

This enables THEOS to **anticipate risk**, not merely react to it.

---

## 8. Non-Override Invariant

No subsystem may:
- Request increased depth
- Negotiate for more explanation
- Circumvent throttling through rhetoric, urgency, or emotional framing

Only the Governor may reallocate depth resources.

---

## 9. Ethical Constraint

Depth throttling must never:
- Obscure truth
- Introduce deception
- Withhold necessary safety information

Reduction is applied only to **form**, never **truth value**.

---

## 10. Commitment Statement

This protocol is binding across:
- All THEOS instances
- All deployment environments
- All operational modes

No optimization, performance goal, or user demand may override Governor-controlled depth governance.
