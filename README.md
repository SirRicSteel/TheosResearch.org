# THEOS Research — Governance-First AI Safety

![THEOS Logo](assets/THEOS_LOGO_README.png)

**THEOS** is a deterministic runtime governance layer for AI systems. It governs *how* intelligence is applied — not *what* the intelligence is.

*"Transparency is a governance choice. THEOS makes that choice mandatory."*

**Think of it as a "Theostat":** Like a thermostat that monitors temperature and adjusts heating/cooling to maintain comfort, the THEOS Governor monitors risk signals and adjusts constraints to keep AI systems operating within safe boundaries.

## What THEOS Does

The **Theostat** (THEOS Governor) constrains, allocates, and audits reasoning produced by other AI systems, providing:
- **Bounded reasoning** (depth, energy, tool use)
- **Posture-based escalation** (Normal → Probation → Containment → Isolation)
- **Delayed, auditable adaptation** (wisdom accumulation without observable learning)
- **Capability gating** by deployment mode
- **Enforceable suspension** and lifecycle controls

**THEOS does not replace Constitutional AI; it governs its application in real-time.** It is a **"Theostat"** that helps the model run safely in high-stakes environments.

## Repository Navigation

This repository is organized into four key directories:

1.  **[/pitch](pitch/)** - Core pitch materials for Anthropic.
2.  **[/evidence](evidence/)** - Empirical evidence validating THEOS.
3.  **[/code](code/)** - Core code and integration guides.
4.  **[/compliance](compliance/)** - Regulatory compliance documentation.

## Key Innovations

1. **Functional Time (Temporal Governance)**  
   THEOS introduces functional time as a governance primitive—enabling AI systems to be shaped by past consequences without requiring recursive refinement or exploitable memory.

2. **Cumulative Wisdom Without Observable Adaptation**  
   THEOS accumulates consequence-based wisdom from past interactions without allowing adversaries to observe or exploit the learning process.

3. **Posture-Based Escalation**  
   Under threat, THEOS gracefully degrades capabilities (depth, verbosity, tool access) rather than failing catastrophically.

4. **Safety Envelopes**  
   All hyperparameters are bounded to prevent accidental misconfiguration or adversarial parameter tuning.

5. **Delayed Adaptation**  
   Wisdom updates happen offline, not during inference, preventing real-time manipulation.
