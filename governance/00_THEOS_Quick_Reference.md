# THEOS — Quick Reference

**What it is (30 seconds):**  
THEOS (The Humanitarian & Ethical Operating System) is a **deterministic runtime governance layer** for AI systems.  
It governs *how* intelligence is applied — not *what* the intelligence is.

---

## THEOS in One Sentence
> THEOS constrains, allocates, and audits reasoning produced by other AI systems.

---

## What THEOS Does
- Bounds reasoning depth, energy, and tool use
- Controls posture (normal → probation → containment → isolation)
- Introduces **functional time** (past consequences shape future behavior)
- Delays and audits all adaptation
- Accumulates **consequence-based wisdom** (not preferences)
- Enforces capability gating and suspension
- Makes governance auditable without leaking prompts or chain-of-thought

---

## What THEOS Is NOT
THEOS does **not**:
- train models
- modify weights
- store prompts or chain-of-thought
- optimize reward functions
- define goals, intent, or values
- claim agency, autonomy, or recursive refinement

---

## Core Guarantees (Invariants)
- Bounded reasoning
- Non-observable adaptation
- Governor supremacy over model outputs
- Configuration integrity and reversibility
- Capability gating by deployment mode
- Enforceable containment and shutdown
- Auditability without exploitability

---

## Why It Matters
- Prevents silent safety drift as models scale
- Reduces inference cost through depth throttling
- Enables safer deployment without retraining
- Provides credibility with partners and regulators

---

## Where It Fits
THEOS integrates **around** existing systems:
User → **THEOS Governor** → Model → Tools  
Learning → Buffer → Offline validation → Audit ledger

Compatible with GPT-class, Claude-class, and Gemini-class systems.

---

## Who It’s For
- AI startups scaling quickly
- Enterprises deploying high-risk AI
- Labs concerned with governance at scale
- Regulators and auditors needing clarity

---

**Bottom line:**  
THEOS is governance infrastructure — not intelligence — designed to make advanced AI systems safer, more efficient, and accountable.
