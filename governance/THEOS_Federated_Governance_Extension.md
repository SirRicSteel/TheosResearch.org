# THEOS — Federated Governance & Consequence Sharing
**Optional, Voluntary Extension**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document describes an **optional federated governance extension** for THEOS that enables *voluntary, non-identifying sharing of abstracted consequence signals* across participating institutions.

The goal is to accelerate **safety convergence and restraint learning** without sharing:
- models
- prompts
- reasoning traces
- objectives
- internal representations

This extension is **not required** for THEOS compliance.

---

## 2. What This Is — and Is Not

### This IS:
- Federated consequence signaling
- Safety event aggregation
- Abstracted wisdom propagation
- Governance-level learning

### This is NOT:
- Collective intelligence
- Shared cognition
- Centralized AI control
- Cross-system command authority
- Model or capability sharing

Each participating system remains **fully sovereign**.

---

## 3. Core Principle

> **AI systems may learn from each other's mistakes  
without learning how each other thinks.**

Only **consequences** propagate — never cognition.

This extends the **functional time** principle (see [THEOS Functional Time](THEOS_Functional_Time.md)) from single-system temporal governance to multi-system consequence sharing.

---

## 4. What Is Shared (Abstracted Only)

Participating THEOS Governors may optionally publish **non-identifying governance telemetry**, such as:

- consequence class (e.g., near-miss, containment, harm)
- severity band (coarse-grained)
- context category (high-level)
- time-decayed frequency signals

No shared data includes:
- prompts
- outputs
- chain-of-thought
- user identity
- proprietary signals

All shared information is:
- anonymized
- aggregated
- time-decayed
- bounded

---

## 5. What Is Never Shared

The following are explicitly prohibited:

- raw or reconstructed prompts
- reasoning traces or internal states
- training data
- model parameters or gradients
- tool invocation details
- institutional identifiers (unless voluntarily disclosed)

This boundary is non-negotiable.

---

## 6. Participation Model

Participation in federated governance is:

- **Voluntary** — opt-in only
- **Revocable** — opt-out at any time
- **Auditable** — local and external
- **Configurable** — per deployment or context
- **Non-binding** — no enforcement authority

Each institution controls:
- what it shares
- when it shares
- whether it continues participation

---

## 7. No Central Authority

The federated layer has:

- no command authority
- no global policy control
- no remote enforcement capability
- no “kill switch”

Each THEOS Governor interprets federated signals **locally**, according to its own invariants and safety envelope.

---

## 8. Safety Guarantee (Critical)

> **Federated governance signals may only increase restraint — never expand capability.**

Federated inputs may:
- raise baseline risk
- shorten escalation thresholds
- reduce allowable depth
- tighten posture transitions

They may **never**:
- enable new capabilities
- loosen constraints
- increase autonomy
- override local governance

---

## 9. Why This Improves Safety Exponentially

Without federation:
- each system learns only from its own incidents

With federated consequence sharing:
- systems learn from **parallel failures worldwide**
- dangerous patterns are recognized earlier
- restraint converges faster
- catastrophic repetition is reduced

This creates exponential *safety* improvement without amplifying intelligence.

---

## 10. THEOS Approved — Governance Mark

A system may display a **“THEOS Approved” governance mark** if it:

- implements core THEOS invariants
- passes governance audit
- maintains configuration integrity
- optionally participates in federated consequence sharing

The mark signifies:
> *This system voluntarily subjects itself to THEOS governance constraints.*

It does **not** imply endorsement of intelligence quality or performance.

---

## 11. Commercial & Institutional Neutrality

THEOS federated governance may be:

- licensed
- white-labeled
- institutionally owned
- deployed privately or consortium-based

THEOS does not require:
- central ownership
- public participation
- exclusive governance networks

This ensures:
- antitrust safety
- institutional sovereignty
- competitive neutrality

---

## 12. Scope & Status

This federated governance concept is:

- optional
- future-facing
- exploratory
- subject to institutional consensus

It is not required for:
- initial adoption
- pilot deployments
- regulatory alignment

---

## 13. Final Statement

> **Federated governance does not create a global AI.  
It creates a global wisdom state derived from consequences.**

This distinction preserves safety, sovereignty, and trust.
