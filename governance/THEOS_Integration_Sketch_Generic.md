# THEOS — Integration Sketch (Model-Agnostic)

## Placement
THEOS sits between:
- user input
- model inference
- tool execution
- learning pipelines

## Flow
1. Request enters Governor
2. Governor sets posture, depth, and tool policy (informed by **functional time** / accumulated wisdom)
3. Model executes within constraints
4. Learning signals buffered
5. Offline validation applies updates (consequence-based wisdom accumulation)
6. Audit ledger records governance actions

THEOS is compatible with GPT-class, Claude-class, and Gemini-class systems.
