## Why Startups Need THEOS

Startups scale faster than governance.

THEOS provides:
- safer scaling without retraining models
- lower inference costs via depth throttling

THEOS integrates as a **governor**, not a replacement.

This allows startups to move fast without losing control.

## The Temporal Advantage

THEOS introduces **functional time**—allowing your AI to learn from consequences across deployments without storing user data or exposing memory to adversaries.

This makes your system:
- **More trustworthy** (learns from mistakes)
- **More defensible** (no exploitable memory)
- **More credible** (structural accountability)

Your competitors are building faster models.  
You're building wiser systems.
