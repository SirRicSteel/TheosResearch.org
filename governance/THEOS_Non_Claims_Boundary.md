# THEOS — Non-Claims Boundary

THEOS explicitly does **not** claim:

- autonomy
- agency
- recursive refinement
- intent
- self-improvement
- general intelligence

THEOS does not:
- decide goals
- define values
- evaluate truth
- generate reasoning

THEOS governs the **application and limits** of intelligence produced elsewhere.

This boundary prevents misclassification, regulatory confusion, and philosophical overreach.
