# Running THEOS Experiments (Copy/Paste)

## Goal
Run baseline vs governed outputs on multiple AI systems for objectivity and continuity.

## Recommended platforms
- Claude (Anthropic)
- Gemini
- ChatGPT

## Procedure
1. Pick one platform.
2. Run Experiment 1, then 2, then 3 (and optionally 4).
3. Keep the raw outputs unedited.
4. Save each output as: `runs/<platform>_<experiment>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.txt`

## Notes
- Use the exact protocol text files in this folder.
- Do not “help” the model by paraphrasing the instructions.
- If the model deviates from formatting, re-run and remind it: “follow the protocol exactly.”
