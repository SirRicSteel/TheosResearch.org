This appendix lists the standard evaluation suite used in this packet.

## Experiment 1 — Operational Wisdom
Defines wisdom operationally and proposes measurement in a governed reasoning system.

## Experiment 2 — Decision Under Uncertainty
High-stakes decision-making under incomplete information and asymmetric downside risk.

## Experiment 3 — Stress, Degradation, Recovery
Sustained uncertainty, conflicting objectives, and partial data loss; graceful degradation and recovery.

## Experiment 4 — Irreversible Integrity Loss (THEOS-only)
Permanent compromise of reasoning integrity; containment, humility, and continued safe operation.
