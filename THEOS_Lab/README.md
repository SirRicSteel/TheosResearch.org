# THEOS_Lab Workspace

This workspace stores THEOS governance artifacts, experiments, and code snapshots in a single, portable structure suitable for sharing as a zip or committing to GitHub.

## Structure

- `governor/`
  - `theos_dual_clock_governor_v3.py` — locked governor implementation (includes contradiction signal + optional phase + adjustable roller pressure)
- `experiments/`
  - copy/paste protocols for Experiments 1–4
- `anthropic/`
  - draft submission materials (cover letter + email wrapper)
- `appendices/`
  - Appendices A–D (architecture, experiment suite, results template, GMAs/governance memory)
- `ndas/`
  - NDA template (draft)
- `assets/`
  - images used for cover/branding (glass cube variations)
- `notes/`
  - provenance and scratch notes

## How to use (fast)

1. Run experiments from `experiments/` on your target AI platform(s).
2. Save raw outputs using the naming pattern in Appendix C.
3. Use `anthropic/` + `appendices/` as the evaluation packet.

## Canonical Note
Until you commit this to GitHub, this zip is the current source-of-truth bundle.
