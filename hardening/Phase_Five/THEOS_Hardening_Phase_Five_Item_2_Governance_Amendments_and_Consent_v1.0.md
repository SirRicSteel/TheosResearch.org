# THEOS Hardening Protocol
## Phase Five – Item 2
### Governance Amendments, Change Control & Consent
**Version:** v1.0
**Status:** Frozen upon acceptance

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines how changes to THEOS governance are proposed, reviewed, approved, communicated, and enacted.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- Governance changes are deliberate and transparent
- Stakeholders are protected from silent shifts
- Consent is meaningful and revocable
- Stability is preserved while evolution remains possible

---

## 2. Core Principle

**No governance change is valid unless it is visible, justified, and consented to.**

Change without consent is treated as drift.

---

## 3. Change Classification

Governance changes are classified into three categories:

### 3.1 Non-Substantive Changes
- Clarifications
- Typographical corrections
- Documentation reorganization

Do not alter intent or effect.

---

### 3.2 Substantive Changes
- Threshold adjustments
- Process modifications
- Role or authority changes

Require review and approval.

---

### 3.3 Fundamental Changes
- Invariant modification
- Priority reordering
- Stewardship authority changes

Require enhanced consent and review.

---

## 4. Proposal Requirements

All governance change proposals must include:
- Change description
- Rationale and objectives
- Impact assessment
- Affected stakeholders
- Risk analysis
- Rollback plan

Incomplete proposals are rejected.

---

## 5. Review & Approval Process

Approval requires:
- Stewardship Body review
- Safety and ethics assessment
- Formal vote or consensus mechanism
- Documentation in the governance ledger

No expedited path exists for fundamental changes.

---

## 6. Consent & Notification

Affected parties must be:
- Notified prior to enactment
- Provided a clear summary of changes
- Given a defined response window

Consent mechanisms vary by change class.

---

## 7. Opt-Out & Revocation Rights

For substantive or fundamental changes:
- Institutions may opt out
- Deployments may be paused
- Capability escalation may be denied

Consent may be revoked prospectively.

---

## 8. Activation & Transition

Approved changes must include:
- Activation date
- Transition period
- Backward compatibility plan (where feasible)

Abrupt activation is prohibited except for safety emergencies.

---

## 9. Audit & Traceability

All governance changes are:
- Logged
- Versioned
- Traceable to approval records
- Subject to retrospective review

Historical governance states must remain reconstructible.

---

## 10. Ethical Constraint

Change control must never:
- Be used to bypass scrutiny
- Quietly expand power or capability
- Undermine previously granted assurances

Stability is a trust obligation.

---

## 11. Commitment Statement

This protocol is binding across:
- All governance updates
- All stewardship actions
- All deployment agreements

No change to THEOS governance may occur outside this process.
