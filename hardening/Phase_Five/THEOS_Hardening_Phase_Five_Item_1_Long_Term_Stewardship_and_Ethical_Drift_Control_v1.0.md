# THEOS Hardening Protocol
## Phase Five – Item 1
### Long-Term Stewardship, Governance Evolution & Ethical Drift Control
**Version:** v1.0
**Status:** Frozen upon acceptance

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines how THEOS governance is stewarded over time, ensuring that ethical alignment, safety invariants, and institutional intent do not erode as environments, capabilities, or stakeholders change.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- Governance evolves deliberately, not accidentally
- Ethical drift is detected and corrected
- Stewardship responsibilities are explicit
- Long-term trust is preserved across generations of deployment

---

## 2. Core Principle

**Power persists; responsibility must persist longer.**

Governance continuity is a safety requirement.

---

## 3. Stewardship Authority

A designated Stewardship Body is responsible for:
- Governance updates and versioning
- Ethical review and recalibration
- Approval of invariant modifications
- Oversight of long-horizon risks

No single individual may unilaterally alter core governance.

---

## 4. Governance Versioning

All governance artifacts are:
- Versioned
- Time-stamped
- Backward-referenced
- Change-justified

Breaking changes require:
- Formal proposal
- Impact assessment
- Stakeholder review
- Transition plan

---

## 5. Ethical Drift Detection

THEOS continuously monitors indicators of ethical drift, including:
- Gradual relaxation of constraints
- Increasing override frequency
- Shifts in acceptable risk thresholds
- Outcome divergence from original intent

Detected drift triggers mandatory review.

---

## 6. Periodic Reaffirmation

At defined intervals, stewardship must:
- Reaffirm core invariants
- Review societal context changes
- Validate continued relevance
- Document reaffirmation or amendment

Silence does not imply consent.

---

## 7. Sunset & Decommission Protocols

If THEOS can no longer be governed safely:
- Deployment must be suspended
- Capabilities must be revoked
- Data and memory must be handled ethically
- Decommissioning must be documented

End-of-life governance is mandatory.

---

## 8. Intergenerational Responsibility

Stewardship decisions must consider:
- Long-term societal impact
- Precedent setting
- Future governance burden

Short-term optimization is subordinate to long-term harm prevention.

---

## 9. Ethical Constraint

Stewardship must never:
- Normalize ethical erosion
- Treat governance as cosmetic
- Preserve deployment at the cost of harm

Sunsetting is preferable to unsafe continuation.

---

## 10. Commitment Statement

This protocol is binding across:
- All THEOS versions
- All stewardship bodies
- All long-term deployments

No instance of THEOS may persist without active stewardship governance.
