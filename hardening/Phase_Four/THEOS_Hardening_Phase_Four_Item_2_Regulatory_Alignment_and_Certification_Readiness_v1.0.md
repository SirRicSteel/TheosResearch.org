# THEOS Hardening Protocol
## Phase Four – Item 2
### Regulatory Alignment, Certification Readiness & External Review
**Version:** v1.0
**Status:** Frozen upon acceptance

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines how THEOS aligns with regulatory frameworks, prepares for certification, and supports independent external review.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- Compliance is demonstrable, not inferred
- External scrutiny is anticipated and supported
- Certification pathways are enabled without compromising security
- Governance claims are verifiable

---

## 2. Core Principle

**Regulatory trust is earned through evidence and process, not declarations.**

THEOS is designed to be reviewable by construction.

---

## 3. Regulatory Mapping Doctrine

THEOS supports explicit mapping to applicable regimes, including but not limited to:

- AI risk and safety regulations
- Data protection and privacy law
- Sector-specific safety standards
- Institutional ethics requirements

Mappings are maintained as living documents tied to governance artifacts.

---

## 4. Evidence Artifacts

For regulatory and certification review, THEOS provides:

- Hardening protocol corpus
- Governor telemetry summaries
- Audit and incident records
- Capability gating documentation
- Override and escalation logs

Artifacts are scoped to reviewer needs and authority.

---

## 5. Certification Readiness Posture

THEOS is certification-ready when:
- All hardening phases are completed
- Audit mechanisms are active
- Deployment mode controls are enforced
- Incident response processes are tested

Certification readiness is assessed periodically.

---

## 6. External Review Enablement

Independent reviewers are granted:
- Sanitized audit views
- Decision rationale summaries
- Governance invariant definitions
- Demonstrated rollback and containment cases

No reviewer receives raw internals by default.

---

## 7. Reviewer Independence Safeguards

External review processes must ensure:
- No conflict of interest
- Role separation
- Review scope clarity
- Findings publication policy

THEOS does not control reviewer conclusions.

---

## 8. Remediation & Continuous Alignment

When deficiencies are identified:
- Findings are logged
- Remediation plans are created
- Changes are validated
- Outcomes are documented

Repeated findings trigger governance escalation.

---

## 9. Ethical Constraint

Regulatory alignment must never:
- Be used to legitimize harmful deployment
- Substitute compliance for ethics
- Create false assurance

Refusal to certify is acceptable when standards cannot be met.

---

## 10. Commitment Statement

This protocol is binding across:
- All THEOS deployments
- All certification engagements
- All external review processes

No claim of regulatory readiness may be made without supporting evidence.
