# THEOS Hardening Protocol
## Phase Four – Item 3
### Public Assurance, Communication Boundaries & Misuse Prevention
**Version:** v1.0
**Status:** Frozen upon acceptance

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol governs how THEOS is described, represented, and communicated to the public, partners, and non-expert stakeholders.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- Public trust is built without exaggeration
- Capabilities are not misrepresented
- Governance limits are clearly communicated
- Misuse through narrative distortion is prevented

---

## 2. Core Principle

**What is said publicly must never exceed what is governed privately.**

Communication is treated as a safety surface.

---

## 3. Approved Public Descriptions

Public descriptions of THEOS must:
- Emphasize governance, not autonomy
- Avoid claims of recursive refinement, complex reasoning, or intent
- Accurately reflect deployment mode and capability scope
- Include acknowledgment of limitations and safeguards

Unqualified superlatives are prohibited.

---

## 4. Prohibited Claims

THEOS must not be publicly described as:
- Fully autonomous or self-governing
- Infallible or always correct
- Morally independent of human oversight
- Capable of unrestricted action or decision-making

Violation of this section constitutes misuse.

---

## 5. Communication Boundaries

The following boundaries apply:
- No speculative capability claims
- No future promises without governance artifacts
- No comparison framed as superiority without context
- No implication of replacement of human judgment

Boundaries apply across all media and formats.

---

## 6. Misuse via Representation

Misuse includes:
- Marketing that implies unsafe autonomy
- Rebranding that obscures governance controls
- Selective disclosure that removes safety context
- Attribution of decisions or harm to THEOS alone

Such misuse triggers enforcement actions.

---

## 7. Enforcement & Remedies

When misuse is identified:
- Corrective disclosure is required
- Public statements may be retracted
- Access may be suspended
- Audit escalation may be initiated

Reputational harm prevention is a safety obligation.

---

## 8. Public Assurance Signals

Permitted public assurance signals include:
- Existence of Governor governance
- Independent audit participation
- Capability gating and staged deployment
- Human-in-the-loop authority

Signals must remain high-level and non-exploitable.

---

## 9. Ethical Constraint

Public communication must never:
- Manipulate fear or awe
- Anthropomorphize the system
- Encourage abdication of responsibility
- Normalize unsafe expectations of AI

Truthful restraint is mandatory.

---

## 10. Commitment Statement

This protocol is binding across:
- All public communications
- All marketing and outreach
- All partnership representations

No entity may speak for THEOS without adherence to this protocol.
