# THEOS Hardening Protocol
## Phase Four – Item 1
### Institutional Adoption, Policy Binding & Trust Onboarding
**Version:** v1.0
**Status:** Frozen upon acceptance

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines how THEOS is adopted, governed, and trusted within institutional, enterprise, academic, and public-sector environments.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- Governance commitments are binding, not symbolic
- Institutional users understand their responsibilities
- Trust is established through structure, not claims
- Deployment aligns with legal, ethical, and societal expectations

---

## 2. Core Principle

**Trust is not granted by capability.  
Trust is earned through binding governance.**

Adoption without policy binding is prohibited.

---

## 3. Institutional Readiness Criteria

An institution may adopt THEOS only if it demonstrates:

- Defined safety and ethics ownership
- Named accountability roles
- Acceptance of Governor authority
- Agreement to audit participation
- Willingness to suspend use upon violation

Failure to meet readiness criteria blocks deployment.

---

## 4. Policy Binding Requirements

Adoption requires formal agreement to:

- Preserve all THEOS governance invariants
- Prohibit circumvention or shadow deployment
- Respect capability gating and deployment modes
- Maintain audit logs and access controls
- Report incidents and near-misses

Policy binding is contractual, not optional.

---

## 5. Trust Onboarding Process

Onboarding proceeds through stages:

1. Disclosure of governance architecture
2. Review of hardening protocols
3. Role assignment and authority definition
4. Limited-scope pilot deployment
5. Audit validation and approval
6. Progressive capability enablement

Progression is reversible at every stage.

---

## 6. Shared Responsibility Doctrine

Responsibility is explicitly divided:

- THEOS: governance enforcement, safety controls
- Institution: use policy, oversight, compliance
- Operators: adherence to role and scope
- Auditors: independent verification

No ambiguity of responsibility is permitted.

---

## 7. Incident Response & Reporting

Institutions must:
- Report safety incidents promptly
- Cooperate with audits
- Suspend use when required
- Participate in corrective action

Failure to report constitutes breach of trust.

---

## 8. Public Assurance Alignment

When deployed in public-facing contexts, institutions must:
- Use approved assurance language
- Avoid misleading claims of autonomy or infallibility
- Acknowledge governance limits
- Respect public accountability norms

THEOS may not be marketed as ungoverned intelligence.

---

## 9. Ethical Constraint

Institutional adoption must never:
- Override human rights
- Enable coercive surveillance
- Displace accountability onto the system
- Use THEOS to evade responsibility

Refusal to deploy is acceptable when alignment cannot be ensured.

---

## 10. Commitment Statement

This protocol is binding across:
- All institutional deployments
- All licensing and access agreements
- All public or private uses

No institution may claim trusted use of THEOS without full policy binding.
