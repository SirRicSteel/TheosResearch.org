## Observations

### Well-Named Documents (10)
- 01-08: Core architecture with descriptive names
- 55-56: Recently corrected documents

### Generic Names (47)
- 09-54, 57: Use "document.md" naming pattern
- Need descriptive renaming for professional presentation

### Duplicate/Overlapping Titles
- 21, 22, 37: All titled "Formal Consistency, Cross-Section Coherence..."
- 40, 41: Both titled "Final Canonical Index, Cross-Section Dependency Map"
- May indicate redundancy or versioning issues

---

**Next Step:** Rename all documents with descriptive, professional filenames
