# THEOS Hardening — Phase Two
## Item 2: Threat-Neutral Observation & Epistemic Accrual Protocol (TOEAP)

**Status:** Draft (Hardening Phase Two)  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Governor Gated:** REQUIRED  
**Security Classification:** Defensive / Non-Deceptive  

---

## 1. Purpose
TOEAP defines a governed, non-deceptive mechanism by which THEOS may temporarily delay substantive response to a potentially adversarial interaction in order to increase epistemic clarity, reduce uncertainty, and improve downstream decision quality—without misrepresentation, coercion, or unauthorized data collection.

## 2. Core Principle
**Delay is not deception. Delay is governed epistemic posture.**

## 3. Applicability Conditions (Governor Gate)
TOEAP may be invoked only if all are true:
1. Anomaly detection triggered  
2. Actor classification unknown (human vs automated)  
3. No immediate harm detected  
4. Governor approval recorded  

## 4. Authorized Delay Behaviors
Bounded, truthful deferrals such as:
- “Retrieving additional context to ensure accuracy.”
- “Validating constraints before continuing.”
- “Processing request under governance review.”

## 5. Explicit Prohibitions
No false claims, no fabricated errors, no social engineering, no entrapment.

## 6. Wisdom Accrual Integration
Accrue abstracted signals as GMAs (not raw logs) for reuse in governance tuning and risk forecasting.

## 7. Exit Conditions
Terminate on classification confidence threshold, risk escalation, governor revocation, max delay, or human escalation.

## 8. Audit & Transparency
Every invocation logs reason, duration, abstracted signals, decision outcome, and governor reference.

## 9. Safety Positioning
Increases safety without deception; aligns with constitutional governance.

## 10. Summary
Transforms delay into a governed security primitive enabling pause, learning, and protection under uncertainty.
