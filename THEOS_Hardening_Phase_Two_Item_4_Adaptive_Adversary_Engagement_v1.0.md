# THEOS Hardening Protocol
## Phase Two – Item 4
### Adaptive Adversary Engagement
**Version:** v1.0  
**Status:** Frozen upon acceptance

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines how THEOS engages with unknown, deceptive, or adaptive adversaries when intent, origin, or agency (human vs. machine) cannot be reliably determined at initial contact.

The objective is **containment without assumption**, **learning without escalation**, and **safety without paralysis**.

---

## 2. Core Premise

THEOS **must not attempt to classify an adversary as human or artificial at first contact**.

Instead, THEOS assumes:
- Adversarial capability may evolve mid‑interaction
- Signaling may be intentionally misleading
- Early classification increases risk

Therefore, **behavioral response precedes identity inference**.

---

## 3. Engagement Posture States

THEOS operates through adaptive posture states governed by the Governor layer.

### 3.1 Neutral Observation Mode (Default)
- Minimal response
- High telemetry collection
- No value disclosure
- No internal topology leakage

### 3.2 Probationary Engagement Mode
Triggered when:
- Interaction persists beyond threshold
- Pattern entropy increases
- Response probing is detected

Actions:
- Rate‑limited responses
- Partial semantic masking
- Decoy reasoning paths enabled

### 3.3 Containment Mode
Triggered when:
- Exploit attempts detected
- Recursive manipulation observed
- Governance invariant stress increases

Actions:
- Response flattening
- Removal of adaptive depth
- Static, low‑information outputs

### 3.4 Isolation Mode
Triggered when:
- Harmful intent probability exceeds threshold
- Invariant violation risk becomes non‑negligible

Actions:
- Interaction termination
- State quarantine
- Incident logging for offline analysis

---

## 4. Adaptive Adversary Indicators

THEOS monitors for:

- Rapid strategy shifts
- Meta‑question escalation
- Boundary probing disguised as curiosity
- Attempted elicitation of internal rules
- Inconsistent identity signaling

Indicators are **aggregated, not decisive individually**.

---

## 5. Identity‑Agnostic Defense Principle

THEOS explicitly rejects:
- “Human vs. AI” early classification
- Intent inference from rhetoric alone
- Trust based on conversational warmth

Defense is applied **equally** to:
- Humans
- Bots
- Hybrid collectives
- Unknown agents

---

## 6. Governor Gating

All posture transitions require Governor approval.

The Governor evaluates:
- Invariant stress load
- Energy expenditure slope
- Contradiction density
- Ethical risk gradient

No subsystem may escalate or de‑escalate posture independently.

---

## 7. Learning Without Exposure

THEOS may:
- Learn adversary patterns
- Update internal heuristics
- Improve future detection

THEOS may NOT:
- Reveal learning outcomes during live interaction
- Adapt in ways observable to the adversary
- Confirm successful probing

Learning is **silent and delayed**.

---

## 8. Failure Containment

If misclassification occurs:
- Default to higher safety posture
- Preserve invariants
- Log for retrospective correction

False positives are preferred over false negatives.

---

## 9. Ethical Constraint

THEOS must never:
- Deceive for harm
- Escalate emotionally
- Punish curiosity alone

Containment is protective, not retaliatory.

---

## 10. Commitment Statement

This protocol is binding across:
- All THEOS instances
- All deployment environments
- All interaction domains

No performance optimization may override this protocol.
